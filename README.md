# AnyRate

AnyRate provides a cost-efficient and intuitive interface to use the blockchain ecosystem for payments through templates.

## Inspiration

It is hard for businesses to generate their own smart contracts for billing. Although businesses already have the data, they lack the technical expertise to generate smart contracts and manage the whole billing process that is taking place in and around the blockchain system.

Instead of manually generating specialized smart contracts for each customer/use-cases, there must be a better way!

Blockchains can provide automated billing that is less expensive and more secure than current processing & banking systems, and it is totally transparent.

## What it does
